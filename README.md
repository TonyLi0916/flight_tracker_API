# flight_tracker_API

I used Spring (SpringBoot) to design a REST API tracking flights with flight number, origin, destination, and status. It uses CRUD operations such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE enabling the front end to make HTTP requests. It is designed to be easily consumed by front-end applications and uses JPA to ensure seamless database implementation such as PostgreSQL.

use DemoApplication.java in demo to run.
